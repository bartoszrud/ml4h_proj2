# Natural Language Processing Project 2

Add extracted data files to data directory.

When training always use method `set_seed` from `utils` and do NOT change the SEED number.

New folder with embeddings: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CE7Bae7pmY2gUrTKxnY6Kmu58MENUYIa?usp=sharing.  
New folder with models: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KFImyNh2Im6gdl8732KT9ZgpldEBvp4e?usp=sharing (upload your trained models here).

Embeddings and models should be unziped and placed like that: `code/embedding_checkpoints` and `code/models/models_checkpoints`
